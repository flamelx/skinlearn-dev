 - The random motions in the beginig and middle, periodic motons in the end

NNCartesianFTSensorForce_2013-09-13-13-54-10.bag
 - Cycles with NNs

NNCartesianFTSensorForce_2013-09-13-14-07-55.bag
 - Cycles with NO NNs

NNCartesianFTSensorForce_2013-09-14-18-59-36.bag
 - All joints actuated, messed up

####
# NEW controller (x) formulation

1 NNCartesianFTSensorForce_2013-09-14-23-01-23.bag
 - NN ON
 - Circles, great response, had noise, did jerk a bit, maybe bacause of learning param?

1 NNCartesianFTSensorForce_2013-09-14-23-23-33.bag
 - NN OFF
 - Circles, seemed harder to use, destabilized a lot, noisy

1 NNCartesianFTSensorForce_2013-09-14-23-35-10.bag
 - NN ON 
 - Feedforward OFF
 - Was easier to move around, but always tried to get into awkward positions

2 NNCartesianFTSensorForce_2013-09-14-23-41-45.bag
 - NN ON
 - Started with arm straight out
 - Noisy
 - Easier to move

2 NNCartesianFTSensorForce_2013-09-14-23-45-34.bag
 - NN OFF
 - Messed up and started with Joint position controllers on too, wait for the break in the midde to get the correct data
 - Was not too bad, seemed less smooth somehow

3 NNCartesianFTSensorForce_2013-09-15-00-01-05.bag
 - NN ON
 - Worked great, was very fast, seemed to follow trajs in plot
 - Still noisy :(

3 NNCartesianFTSensorForce_2013-09-15-00-18-47.bag
 - NN OFF
 - No noise
 - motion was stiff and jerky

4 NNCartesianFTSensorForce_2013-09-15-00-24-09.bag
 - NN ON
 - Noisy, arm got into awkward positions

5 NNCartesianFTSensorForce_2013-09-15-00-27-18.bag
 - NN ON
 - Noisy, did not look like it was tracking

6 NNCartesianFTSensorForce_2013-09-15-00-31-20.bag
 - NN ON
 - Not noisy but terrible performance
